This example demonstrates an uncommon error in Groovy related to the `sum()` method's behavior with lists of different data types.  The `sum()` method works correctly on numerical lists but throws an exception when encountering a list of strings. The solution showcases how to handle this situation using a custom summation method or type checking. This issue highlights the importance of considering data type handling when using Groovy's collection methods.
